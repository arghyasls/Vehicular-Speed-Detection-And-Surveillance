ABSTRACT
This project aims to solve the fundamental problems of traffic violations like over speeding by
coming up with a two-fold approach which involves both the fields of Computer Vision and Arduino
Microcontrollers. The system consists of two IR sensors which are kept separate at a fixed distance
and the time instants of motion of the vehicle is calculated at the two points. Alternative approach is
a computer vision based surveillance camera which can record the speed by using motion detection
technique of Background Subtraction. The entire project is an example of an Internet Of Things (IOT)
system which can be implemented in smart cities for automatic monitoring and regulation of traffic
without the need of any human supervision. We hope to reduce the number of traffic accidents and
aid the traffic policemen in their work through this project.The speed calculated has been tested in
many experiments and proven to have achieved a satisfactory performance.

KEYWORDS
